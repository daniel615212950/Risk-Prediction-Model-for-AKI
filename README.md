# ***\*Abstract\****

**Background** Acute kidney injury (AKI) is not a rare complication during anti-tuberculosis treatment in some patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB).  We aimed to develop a risk prediction model to early recognize PTB patients at high risk of AKI during anti-TB treatment.

***\*Methods\**** This retrospective cohort study, clinical baseline, and laboratory test data of 315 inpatients with active PTB were screened for predictive factors from January 2019 to June 2020.  The elements were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. A nomogram was established by the results of the logistic regression analysis.  The prediction model discrimination and calibration were evaluated by the concordance index (C-Index), ROC Curve, and Hosmer-Lemeshow analysis.

***\*Results\**** 315 PTB patients were enrolled (67 AKI patients and 248 patients without AKI). 7 factors: microalbuminuria, hematuria, cysteine protease inhibitor C (CYS-C), albumin (ALB), creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate estimates (eGFR), body mass index (BMI) and CA-125 are acquired to develop the predictive model.  According to the logistic regression, microalbuminuria (OR=3.038, 95% CI 1.168-7.904), hematuria (OR=3.656, 95% CI 1.325-10.083), CYS-C (OR=4.416, 95% CI 2.296-8.491), CA-125 (OR=3.93, 95% CI 1.436-10.756) were risk parameter and ALB (OR=0.741, 95% CI 0.650-0.844) was protective parameter.  The nomogram demonstrated a good prediction in estimating AKI. C-Index= 0.967, AUC=0.967, 95% CI (0.941-0.984) Sensitivity=91.04%, Specificity=93.95%, Hosmer-Lemeshow analysis SD=0.00054, Quantile of absolute error=0.049.   

***\*Conclusion\**** Microalbuminuria, hematuria, ALB reduction, elevated CYS-C, and CA125 are predictive factors for AKI in PTB patients during anti-tuberculosis treatments. The predictive nomogram based on five predictive factors is achieved a good risk prediction of AKI during anti-tuberculosis treatments.
